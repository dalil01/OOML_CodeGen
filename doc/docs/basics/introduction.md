# Introduction

Welcome to the **Ooml Code Gen in 5 minutes** discovery guide.

## Project Context

Ooml Code Gen is a powerful tool that allows you to generate code from a text file. The code generation process is based
on the principles of UML (Unified Modeling Language). The idea is to write a text file that describes the structure and
relationships of objects in your application, and then use Ooml Code Gen to read, parse, and transpile it into an
object-oriented code structure.

## Key Features

- **Code Generation**: Ooml Code Gen enables you to quickly and easily create classes, interfaces, methods, and other
  code elements from a text file.
- **Relationship Management**: You can define relationships between objects, such as inheritance, association, and
  composition, and Ooml Code Gen will generate the corresponding code.
- **Customization**: You have the ability to customize the generated code templates and transformation rules to suit
  your specific needs.
- **Multi-language Support**: Ooml Code Gen supports multiple popular programming languages, including Java, C++, C#,
  Python, and more.
